# Salesforce Plugin for Steampipe - A streamlined way to query Salesforce via ODBC via this Steampipe plugin. 

This fork is a (working) experiment and thus should not be relied on for production environments. 
Summary of changes:
- disables conversion of field API names to snake_case  (eg. CreatedDate to created_date)
- lower-cases all field API names for simplicity (and convenience) when writing sql queries
- reduced the 'static tables' intitialized down to a single mostly unused object in Salesforce 'Pricebook2' (ignores all the salesforce_ schemas that come out of the box with this plugin) thus allowing for dynamically mapped object schemas

Forked from https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-salesforce on March 22, 2023.

Built for linux with libraries embeded using...

'''shell
go build -o -arch=amd64 -os=linux ~/.steampipe/plugins/hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/salesforce@latest/steampipe-plugin-salesforce.plugin *.go
'''
